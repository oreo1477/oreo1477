- 👋 Hi, I’m @oreo1477
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (and occasionally pretending to know what I'm doing).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding (and still figuring out what "refactoring" really means).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing (but if you have an offer, I’ll consider it... maybe).
- 📫 How to reach me: (don’t) – I’m a bit of a coding hermit.
- 😐 Pronouns: There are only 2 sets of pronouns, "he/him" and "she/her" and you cannot change my mind
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am Batman. (No, really, I am.) Also, I once tried to code a game where the main character was a potato. Spoiler: it was groundbreaking.
